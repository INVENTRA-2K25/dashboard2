## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 84%, 52% which translates to a RGB hex value of #3399FF. This lively, pure blue projects intelligence and creativity.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 96% which translates to a RGB hex value of #F0F5FF. A very light tint of blue will maintain consistency with the primary, while visually receding into the background.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 74%, 44% which translates to a RGB hex value of #2BB9B9. Using cyan reinforces the overall high-tech futuristic feel of the experience, and provides sufficient saturation and brightness contrast.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, will be used for all the headers.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, provides excellent readability, especially on digital displays. Space Grotesk can be used for shorter runs of body text if needed.

- Employs a card-based layout, complemented by a clear and navigable sidebar for an enhanced user experience. Includes a top navigation bar for quick access to main features.
